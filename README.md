# Reverb - CS322 Music Programming Project

## Description

- Reverb is a web application which enables users to edit their audio files directly in the browser without having to download any external software.â€‹
- The goal is to create a beginner friendly and simplified audio editing interface so that it is accessible to as many people as possible.
- This project was created as part of the CS322: Music Programming 2 module at <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/">Maynooth University</a> in my first semester of my final year.

## Technology

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
